General Info:
1. Matches the 8 stages of vanilla wheat crop growth.
2. Collision/Hitbox is very close to that of vanilla.
3. Loot tables match that of the vanilla with a diffirence in the seeds from fully grown crop ratio.
4. For the item to play the correct sound upon placing the block sound needs to be defined within blocks.json.
5. Vanilla wheat crop textures are in a array in the vanilla terrain_texture so they need to be manually defined yourself.
6. Block is using a placement filter to only work on the "UP" face of farmland. This acts as a replication of the block support mechanic and will break the block if the farmland has became dry.
7. Uses random_ticking so will be effect by a set tick speed. 
Problems:
1. Crop drops block instead of item when silk touch is used.
2. Fortune does not apply.
3. Full Grown loot table needs to be properly matched with the vanilla (See 'https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Wheat_Seeds' for refrence)
4. Model is broken due to it going 1 pixel below to match vanilla crops. The model cap size was recently changed to 1 block so matching the vanilla model is currently impossible atm. 
Potential Solutions:


1. define all tools for silk touch and fortune in the loot tables. Silk touch to drop the same thing but the fortune to increase the drop rate proportinal to the vanilla rate.
//Note: Tried this in the loot table with the 'match_tool' but wasn't working. Might be doing something wrong.
2. Define full grown loot tables in percentaged weights to match that of vanilla wheat crop. (See link above for refrence)
