General Info:
1. Collision matches that of vanilla.
2. Candles can be extenquished with your hand.
3. Candles can be lit via flint and steel or firecharge.
4. Blocks can be waterlogged.
Problems:
1. Particles don't perfectly match the vanilla candles. Timing is a bit off and the offset isn't perfect.
2. Can be interacted with no matter what even if no conditions are met.
3. Buckets are going to @p instead of @s. Had to use @p because structures were being loaded at the players position.
4. Particles are not on same range as vanilla candles (but close).
5. Candles can be lit even when waterlogged.
6. BIG PROBLEM. Blocks become unsable after un-waterlogging it.  (Currently working on this, some issue with structures.)
Potential Solutions:
Not going to fix the particles. :)
Use sequences to have the give command for buckets in a seperate run_command.
TO-DO:
Replace /give commands with /loot command.




- I don't have time to write detailed notes right now.


Changes Log:
- fixed giving water buckets instead of regular ones when water logging.
