General Info:
1. Collision matches that of vanilla.
2. Candles can be extenquished with your hand.
3. Candles can be lit via flint and steel or firecharge.
4. Blocks can be waterlogged.
Problems:
1. Particles don't perfectly match the vanilla candles. Timing is a bit off and the offset isn't perfect.
2. Can be interacted with no matter what even if no conditions are met.
3. Buckets are going to @p instead of @s. Had to use @p because structures were being loaded at the players position.
Potential Solutions:
Not going to fix the particles. :)
Use sequences to have the give command for buckets in a seperate run_command.
TO-DO:
Nothing




- I don't have time to write detailed notes right now.
